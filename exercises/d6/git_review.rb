3. What is the difference between staged and committed (or versioned) files? When might you stage something and not commit it?
staging area: loading dock where I can decide which changes I want to ship(commit)
The staged files: the files that any changes have been made that are not saved in the local respo yet. 
THe committed files: any changes made with the files are saved in local git respo.
